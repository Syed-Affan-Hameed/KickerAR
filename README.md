# KickerAR
Kick Boxing animation Augmented reality Application. Made using Google's ARCore Platfrom with Sceneform library tools

This application renders a character into your room using your doormat as reference.
I tested this application in the Android Emulator as I dont have a device which supports latest Google ARCore play services.

# Setup
Refer to the google article below to setup your android emulator to support ARCore and run AR apps without the physical device.
